# SPUDSIM
Source code for SPUDSIM, a mechanistic, process level crop simulation model for potato

SPUDSIM is a mechanistic, process level crop simulation model. The model simulates hourly growth and development of the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) from emergence through maturity in response to weather, soils, management, and genetics. The model can be integrated with other USDA-ARS-ACSL models to simulate rotations. SPUDSIM is integrated with the two-dimensional soils model (2DSOIL) to allow better representation of soil heat, water, nutrient, and gas movement along with root growth and distribution. Outcomes including agronomic yield, nitrogen and water use efficiencies, plant gas exchange processes, soil N leaching and CO2 respiration, and other responses are available.

Current version is SPUDSIM v2-2 which includes simulation of surface residue decomposition, surface water runoff, gas diffusion in the soil, soil CO2,N2O fluxes, and ponding.
